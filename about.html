          Courtney and Michael met in 2008 at Villanova University. The two became fast friends on the first day of classes as Michael, the smooth sophomore, saved a seat for Courtney, the timid freshman. They planned their first on-campus date to have lunch at the Connolly Center. Courtney got honey mustard all over her face, and Michael kindly provided the napkins. Weeks later, sparks flew on their first off-campus date as Courtney grabbed Michael’s hand in a Taco Bell. The two played the long game, and were ready to be official in 2010.

          Michael moved to Austin, TX in 2013 to pursue his master’s degree at the University of Texas at Austin. Courtney got a job in New Jersey and visited Michael whenever schedules allowed. In 2015, Michael graduated and the pair moved together to Tulsa, OK. For the next 3 years, Courtney and Michael explored the country. They cruised highways to their favorite classic rock jams, hiked through nature, and followed the Villanova basketball team to 2 national championships (go Cats!). The couple spent a year in Denver, CO followed by a year in Midland, TX. In December 2017, Michael proposed to Courtney in Courtney’s childhood home with family nearby to celebrate. In the summer of 2018, the couple moved back to New Jersey for their next adventure.
